          + Intellectual Property Knowledge Base, IPKB, is a productivity tool created during the off-hours 
          tailored to my needs to reference legal text in business emails.

          + Featuring Intellectual Property Laws and Regulations, IPKB is built specifically for intellectual 
          property practitioners, such as IP attorneys, patent engineers, and IP paralegal assistants. 
          It organizes legal text in a unique way familiar to the industry, and offers approaches to search, 
          locate, index, and reference IP-relevant legal text.

          + With modern design and PWA architecture, IPKB is managed to perform its full capabilities even in 
          offline mode. 

          + Built using React and Docusaurus, IPKB is currently a non-profit and 
          non-commercial website developed, operated and maintained solely by me.
